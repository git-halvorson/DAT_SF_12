I am following this tutorial which is not in a notebook. Once I have it all working I will create a notebook.

The project idea is to use a recent http://http://www.sanfrancisco.ml/ “Recurrent Neural Networks for
General Sequence Leaning” (http://bit.ly/1E6SPeQ) tutorial. This uses the Python Theano library and the
movie db (http://stanford.io/1yxYRC2) and blogger corpus (http://bit.ly/1yK3mtF). Time permitting a python 
scraper could also be used to get more updated text data.

The goal would to be predict wheather or male or female wrote the blog. But the real goal is to just learn how to use the 
Theano library and how easy it is (and advatanges) versus say the R nmle or other Bayes Classifiers.
